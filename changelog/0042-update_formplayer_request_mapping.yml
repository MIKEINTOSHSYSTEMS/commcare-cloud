context: |
  A small change to the nginx request matching for Formplayer requests that will prevent
  an additional `/` from being prepended to the Formplayer requests.

details: |
  With the current configuration Formplayer requests are getting an additianal `/` prepended
  to the request path resulting in requests like `//new-form`.

  Updating the nginx configuration will remove the double slash from Formplayer requests.

  Future versions of Formplayer will reject requests containing double slashes.

update_steps: |
  ```shell
  commcare-cloud <env> ap deploy_proxy.yml --tags=nginx_sites
  ```
