context: |
  We will be adding SAML 2.0 Single Sign On (SSO) support over the next few months which
  requires installing new `apt` packages as dependencies of python requirements.

details: |
  In order to install python dependencies necessary for handling SAML 2.0 authentication
  on CommCare HQ, we must install several `apt` packages that are dependencies of these
  new `pip` requirements. Any machine running `commcarehq` code must have these `apt` packages
  installed in order for `pip` requirements installations to complete successfully.

update_steps: |
  Run the following `deploy-stack` command:

  ```shell
  commcare-cloud <env> deploy-stack --tags=hq-apt-requirements
  ```
