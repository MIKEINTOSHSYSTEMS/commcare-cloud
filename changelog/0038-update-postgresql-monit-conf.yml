  Update PostgreSQL monit configuration files to be version specific and use `systemctl`

details: |
  When upgrading PostgreSQL you are likely to have both old and new versions installed on the same machine.
  In order to provide full controll over the individual service processes with monit it is necessary to use
  different configurations for each one.

  This change includes the version number in the file name and also updates the config to allow
  monit to control only the process with that version (instead of all PostgreSQL processes on the host).

update_steps: |
  ```bash
  commcare-cloud <env> ansible-playbook deploy_postgres.yml --tags monit
  ```
