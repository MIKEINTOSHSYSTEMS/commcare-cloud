  Run command to uninstall older ansible version which 2.9.26 and install 4.2.0
details: |
  As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
  libraries we have updated the Ansible version to use the ansible==4.2.0. During that
  process we have test this approach on new servers and we have to uninstall the existing version 
  and install the 4.2.0
update_steps: |
  1. Pull the latest commcare-cloud master branch into the control machine
  2. Run following command to reset the cchq env
    ```bash
      source <pathToDir>/commcare-cloud/source/init.sh
    ```
     You can achieve both of these at once by simply running `update-code` on the control machine 
     (which is an alias that is set up by `init.sh`, which is typically configured to run upon login).
