A word of caution
-----------------

CommCare HQ is a complex, distributed software application, made up of dozens of processes and several pieces of third-party open source database software. It has been built for scale rather than simplicity, and as a result even for small deployments a CommCare server or server cluster can be challenging to maintain. An organization endeavoring to manage their own CommCare server environment must be willing to devote considerable effort and system administration capacity not only in the initial phases of provisioning, setup, and installation, but in steady state as well.

If you or your organization is hosting or interested in hosting its own CommCare server environment, we strongly suggest you read our Hosting Considerations page before going any further.

You should also be familiar with our Expecations for Ongoing Maintenance.
