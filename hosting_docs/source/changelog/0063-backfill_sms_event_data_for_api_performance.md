# 63. Backfill SMS event data for API performance

**Date:** 2022-11-11

**Optional per env:** _only required on some environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
The following version of CommCare must be deployed before rolling out this change:
[a9671d99](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq/commit/a9671d99e48134080050af32d62a0b545acab496)


## Change Context
Backfill data in the `sms_smssubevent` table to improve the performance of the 'messaging-event' API.

This operation is only required if your environment is using SMS or Email workflows.

## Details
To improve the performance of the 'messaging-event' API we have denormalized one of the date fields.
This field is already being populated for new data but a command needs to be executed to populate
the column for existing data.

## Steps to update
Execute the following command:

```shell
$ commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux backfill_sms_subevent_date 
```

Precautions:
* No downtime is needed for this operation however it is best to run the command during a period
  of low traffic.
