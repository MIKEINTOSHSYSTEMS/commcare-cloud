# 52. upgrade-ansible

**Date:** 2022-08-19

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Run command to uninstall older ansible version which 2.9.26 and install 4.2.0

## Details
As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
libraries we have updated the Ansible version to use the ansible==4.2.0. During that
process we have test this approach on new servers and we have to uninstall the existing version 
and install the 4.2.0

## Steps to update
1. Pull the latest commcare-cloud master branch into the control machine
2. Run following command to reset the cchq env
  ```bash
    source <pathToDir>/commcare-cloud/source/init.sh
  ```
    You can achieve both of these at once by simply running `update-code` on the control machine
    (which is an alias that is set up by `init.sh`, which is typically configured to run upon login).
