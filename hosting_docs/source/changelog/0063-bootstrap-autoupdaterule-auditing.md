## Change Context
Run command to create bootstrap audit records for existing AutomaticUpdateRule records.

## Details
CommCare HQ uses the `django-field-audit` library to track changes on AutomaticUpdateRule models. 
This command ensures that the database records for this model which were created prior to adding 
auditing get a required "bootstrap" record in the audit table.

## Steps to update
Run the following command to create the bootstrap audit records:

```bash
cchq <env> django-manage bootstrap_field_audit_events top-up AutomaticUpdateRule
```
