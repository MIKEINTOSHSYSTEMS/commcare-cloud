# To generate a Github apikey follow these instructions: https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens
# Minimally you will need a key with repo -> public_repo

# On a control machine shared with others,
# leave this as None to be prompted for a token each time instead,
# to avoid storing private github token where others could access it.

GITHUB_APIKEY = None
