## Change Context
Run management command to update shell runner scripts for django and celery.

## Details
The runner scripts used by `supervisord` to run celery and django have been
updated so that they reflect the "wrapped exit code" when they exit. This
provides visibility of the django/celery exit status by viewing the
`supervisord` logs.

## Steps to update
Run the following management command to update supervisor configs:

```bash
cchq <env> update-supervisor-confs
```
