# 73. Prepare project spaces for Case List Explorer report release

**Date:** 2023-06-14

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
We have created a management command to assist with syncing data to the Case Search Index so that legacy projects 
may access data in a new report that will be made generally available.

## Details
We will be releasing a new report in the next couple of months that will access case data from the Case Search 
Index rather than the default Case Index in Elasticsearch.

In order to prepare for this change, we recommend that you run the management command below inside a terminal 
multiplexer like screen or tmux to avoid disruptions from broken ssh tunnels.

## Steps to update
1) Deploy the latest version of commcare-hq.

2) Start a new tmux (recommended) session using
```bash
commcare-cloud <env> django-manage --tmux
```

3) Run the management command from within the tmux session inside the commcare-hq python virtualenv
```bash
python manage.py prepare_projects_for_case_list_explorer
```

Note: that if you have a lot of data to sync, there is a possibility that the command might time out. In that case, 
please re-run the command until the initial sync and data integrity checks are complete.
